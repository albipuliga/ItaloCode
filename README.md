# Italian Cuisine Inspired Programming Language

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a simple, user-friendly programming language based on C, inspired by Italian cuisine and language. It's designed to make programming accessible and engaging, especially for Italian speakers and culinary enthusiasts.

## Features
- **Culinary-Themed Syntax**: Utilizes Italian culinary terms for programming constructs, making it intuitive for our target audience.
- **Simple and Educational**: Ideal for beginners and educational purposes, particularly in Italian learning environments.
- **Focus on Basic Programming Concepts**: Emphasizes fundamental concepts in programming without the complexity of more advanced languages.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts.
- C compiler (like GCC) installed on your system.

### Installation
- Clone the repository: `git clone [repository link]`
- Compile the source files using your C compiler.
- Run the executable to start using the language interpreter.

## Usage
Write your code using the Italian culinary-themed syntax. For example:
- `CIAO()` as the main function.
- Data types like `CARBS`, `VEGGIE` for integers and strings.
- Control structures like `Fusilli` for loops.

Refer to the documentation for detailed syntax and examples.
